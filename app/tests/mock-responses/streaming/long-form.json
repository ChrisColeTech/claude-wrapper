      "content": "# Complete Guide to Building a REST API with Node.js and Express\n\nBuilding a robust REST API is a fundamental skill for modern web development. This comprehensive tutorial will guide you through creating a full-featured API from scratch, covering everything from basic setup to advanced features like authentication and error handling.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore we begin, ensure you have the following installed:\n- Node.js (version 14 or higher)\n- npm or yarn package manager\n- A code editor (VS Code recommended)\n- Basic understanding of JavaScript and HTTP concepts\n\n## Setting Up the Project\n\nFirst, let's create a new project directory and initialize our Node.js application:\n\n```bash\nmkdir my-api-project\ncd my-api-project\nnpm init -y\n```\n\nInstall the required dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express cors helmet morgan dotenv\nnpm install --save-dev nodemon @types/node\n```\n\n## Creating the Basic Server\n\nCreate an `app.js` file in your project root:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst cors = require('cors');\nconst helmet = require('helmet');\nconst morgan = require('morgan');\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\nconst app = express();\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\n// Middleware\napp.use(helmet());\napp.use(cors());\napp.use(morgan('combined'));\napp.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' }));\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n\n// Basic route\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.json({ message: 'API is running successfully!' });\n});\n\n// Start server\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\n## Implementing CRUD Operations\n\nLet's create a simple user management system. First, we'll create a mock database:\n\n```javascript\n// data/users.js\nlet users = [\n  { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' },\n  { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', email: 'jane@example.com' }\n];\n\nlet nextId = 3;\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  users,\n  getNextId: () => nextId++\n};\n```\n\nNow, let's create our user routes:\n\n```javascript\n// routes/users.js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst router = express.Router();\nconst { users, getNextId } = require('../data/users');\n\n// GET all users\nrouter.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.json({\n    success: true,\n    data: users,\n    count: users.length\n  });\n});\n\n// GET user by ID\nrouter.get('/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const user = users.find(u => u.id === id);\n  \n  if (!user) {\n    return res.status(404).json({\n      success: false,\n      message: 'User not found'\n    });\n  }\n  \n  res.json({\n    success: true,\n    data: user\n  });\n});\n\n// POST create new user\nrouter.post('/', (req, res) => {\n  const { name, email } = req.body;\n  \n  if (!name || !email) {\n    return res.status(400).json({\n      success: false,\n      message: 'Name and email are required'\n    });\n  }\n  \n  const newUser = {\n    id: getNextId(),\n    name,\n    email\n  };\n  \n  users.push(newUser);\n  \n  res.status(201).json({\n    success: true,\n    data: newUser,\n    message: 'User created successfully'\n  });\n});\n\n// PUT update user\nrouter.put('/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const userIndex = users.findIndex(u => u.id === id);\n  \n  if (userIndex === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({\n      success: false,\n      message: 'User not found'\n    });\n  }\n  \n  const { name, email } = req.body;\n  \n  if (name) users[userIndex].name = name;\n  if (email) users[userIndex].email = email;\n  \n  res.json({\n    success: true,\n    data: users[userIndex],\n    message: 'User updated successfully'\n  });\n});\n\n// DELETE user\nrouter.delete('/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);\n  const userIndex = users.findIndex(u => u.id === id);\n  \n  if (userIndex === -1) {\n    return res.status(404).json({\n      success: false,\n      message: 'User not found'\n    });\n  }\n  \n  users.splice(userIndex, 1);\n  \n  res.json({\n    success: true,\n    message: 'User deleted successfully'\n  });\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n```\n\n## Adding Input Validation\n\nInstall validation middleware:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express-validator\n```\n\nCreate validation middleware:\n\n```javascript\n// middleware/validation.js\nconst { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');\n\nconst validateUser = [\n  body('name').isLength({ min: 2 }).withMessage('Name must be at least 2 characters'),\n  body('email').isEmail().withMessage('Must be a valid email'),\n  \n  (req, res, next) => {\n    const errors = validationResult(req);\n    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {\n      return res.status(400).json({\n        success: false,\n        message: 'Validation errors',\n        errors: errors.array()\n      });\n    }\n    next();\n  }\n];\n\nmodule.exports = { validateUser };\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nCreate a global error handler:\n\n```javascript\n// middleware/errorHandler.js\nconst errorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {\n  console.error(err.stack);\n  \n  res.status(err.status || 500).json({\n    success: false,\n    message: err.message || 'Internal Server Error',\n    ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && { stack: err.stack })\n  });\n};\n\nmodule.exports = errorHandler;\n```\n\n## Testing the API\n\nCreate test scripts in your `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node app.js\",\n    \"dev\": \"nodemon app.js\",\n    \"test\": \"curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTest your endpoints using curl or Postman:\n\n```bash\n# Get all users\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users\n\n# Create a new user\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\": \"Bob Johnson\", \"email\": \"bob@example.com\"}'\n\n# Update a user\ncurl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/users/1 \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\": \"John Updated\"}'\n\n# Delete a user\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/users/1\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou've successfully created a complete REST API with Node.js and Express! This foundation provides:\n\n- CRUD operations for user management\n- Input validation and error handling\n- Proper HTTP status codes and response formatting\n- Security middleware integration\n- Structured project organization\n\nFrom here, you can extend the API by adding:\n- Database integration (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)\n- Authentication and authorization\n- Rate limiting and caching\n- API documentation with Swagger\n- Unit and integration tests\n\nKeep building and happy coding!",
