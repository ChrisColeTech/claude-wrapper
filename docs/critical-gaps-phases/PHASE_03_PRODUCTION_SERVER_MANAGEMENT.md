# Phase 03A & 03B: Production Server Management

## Phase 03A: Production Server Management Implementation

**Goal**: Implement robust production server management with automatic port conflict resolution  
**Complete Feature**: Production-ready server management with enhanced startup and shutdown  
**Dependencies**: Phase 02B must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Claude SDK Reference**: main.py:835-887 - find_available_port() and run_server() functions
**Performance Requirement**: Port scan <1s, server startup <3s, shutdown <2s

```

### What Gets Implemented

- Automatic port conflict detection and resolution (scan range 8000-8099)
- Production server startup with comprehensive validation and health checks
- Graceful shutdown handling with proper cleanup and resource release
- Health monitoring with detailed status reporting and metrics
- Port reservation and management to prevent conflicts
- Startup failure recovery with detailed error reporting and suggestions
- Server lifecycle events and monitoring hooks
- Production-ready logging and operational visibility

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **SOLID Principles**:
  - **SRP**: ProductionServerManager handles only server lifecycle operations (<200 lines)
  - **OCP**: Extensible for new server management strategies via strategy pattern
  - **LSP**: All server managers implement IProductionServerManager interface consistently
  - **ISP**: Separate interfaces for IPortManager, IHealthMonitor
  - **DIP**: Depend on ISessionService from Phase 02 and session abstractions from prior phases
- **File Size Limits**: All files <200 lines, functions <50 lines, max 5 parameters
- **DRY Compliance**: Extract common server management patterns to ServerManagementUtils
- **No Magic numbers**: All port ranges and server configuration values in src/claude/constants.ts
- **Error Handling**: Consistent ServerManagementError with specific server operation status and detailed troubleshooting information
- **TypeScript Strict**: All server managers code passes strict TypeScript compilation
- **Interface Design**: Maximum 5 methods per interface, single-purpose interfaces

### Anti-Pattern Prevention (MANDATORY)

- **No God Classes**: ProductionServerManager <200 lines, focused on production server management only
- **No Deep Nesting**: Maximum 3 levels in server lifecycle logic, use early returns
- **No Inline Complex Logic**: Extract server management rules to named methods
- **No Hardcoded Values**: All server configuration and port management in constants
- **No Magic numbers**: Use PORT_RANGE.START, HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVALS.DEFAULT

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all production server management logic before proceeding to Phase 03B
- **Unit tests**: Port manager, production server manager, health monitor edge cases
- **Integration tests**: Complete server lifecycle with port conflicts and health monitoring
- **Mock objects**: Mock system ports for testing, real server lifecycle for integration
- **Error scenario tests**: Port unavailable, startup failures, shutdown timeouts, health check failures
- **Performance tests**: Port scan <1s, server startup <3s, shutdown <2s

### Quality Gates for Phase 03A Completion

- ✅ All SOLID principles followed (verified via code review checklist)
- ✅ No anti-patterns present (ESLint max-lines, complexity, depth rules pass)
- ✅ 100% test passing achieved (Jest passing report)
- ✅ **All tests must pass** before proceeding to Phase 03B (unit + integration + performance)
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes (tsc --strict --noEmit)
- ✅ ESLint passes without warnings (npm run lint)
- ✅ production server management demonstrable (integration test passing)
- ✅ Claude SDK compatibility verified (Matches Python server management behavior including port fallback logic)
- ✅ Performance criteria met (port scanning <1s, server startup <3s, graceful shutdown <2s)

### Claude SDK Compatibility Verification

- ✅ Automatic port conflict resolution works like Python implementation
- ✅ Server startup with comprehensive validation and clear error messages
- ✅ Graceful shutdown responds to SIGTERM/SIGINT with proper cleanup
- ✅ Health monitoring provides detailed status and operational metrics
- ✅ Production logging and error reporting for operational visibility

### Testable Features

- Port conflict resolution automatically finds available ports
- Production server startup with validation and health checks
- Graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup
- Health monitoring with detailed status reporting
- Error handling for all server management scenarios
- **Ready for immediate demonstration** with production server management examples

## Phase 03B: Production Server Management - Comprehensive Review

**Goal**: Ensure 100% production server management compatibility and production-quality implementation
**Review Focus**: Reliability, robustness, and performance
**Dependencies**: Phase 03A must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Standards**: `docs/CLAUDE_SDK_REFERENCE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_RULES.md`

### Comprehensive Review Requirements (MANDATORY)

#### 1. Production Server Management Audit Audit

- **Port Conflict Resolution**: Must work reliably and match Python behavior.
- **Startup/Shutdown**: Must be robust and handle all lifecycle events gracefully.
- **Health Monitoring**: Must provide accurate and timely health status.
- **Logging**: Must provide sufficient visibility for production operations.

#### 2. Test Quality Review

- **Replace ALL placeholder tests** with real production server management functionality tests
- **Port Conflict Tests**: Simulate port conflicts and verify resolution.
- **Lifecycle Tests**: Test server startup, shutdown, and signal handling.
- **Health Check Tests**: Verify health monitoring and reporting.
- **Logging Tests**: Ensure logs are comprehensive and correctly formatted.

#### 3. Integration Validation

- **CLI Integration**: Test server management from the command line.
- **Health Check Integration**: Ensure health checks are accessible via API.
- **Logging Integration**: Verify logs are correctly aggregated and correlated.

#### 4. Architecture Compliance Review

- **Single Responsibility**: server managers components have single purposes
- **Dependency Injection**: ProductionServerManager depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Interface Segregation**: IPortManager, IHealthMonitor interfaces are focused (max 5 methods)
- **Error Handling**: Consistent ServerManagementError formatting
- **File Size Compliance**: All files under 200 lines, functions under 50 lines
- **DRY Compliance**: No duplicate server lifecycle logic

#### 5. Performance Validation

- **Port Scan**: <1s completion time.
- **Server Startup**: <3s to become fully operational.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: <2s to complete.

#### 6. Documentation Review

- **Deployment Guide**: Document production server management features.
- **Operations Guide**: Provide instructions for operating the server in production.
- **Health Checks**: Document the health monitoring endpoints and their meanings.

### Quality Gates for Phase 03B Completion

- ✅ **100% production server management functionality verified**
- ✅ **All production server management tests are comprehensive and production-ready** - no placeholders
- ✅ **production server management integrates correctly** with Production server environment
- ✅ **Architecture compliance achieved** - SOLID/DRY principles followed, ESLint passes
- ✅ **Performance validation completed** - all speed requirements met (port scanning <1s, server startup <3s, graceful shutdown <2s)
- ✅ **All tests must pass** before proceeding to Phase 04A (unit + integration + performance)
- ✅ **Documentation accuracy verified** - all docs reflect actual implementation

### Failure Criteria (Phase 03B Must Restart)

- ❌ Port conflict resolution doesn't work or fails to find ports
- ❌ Server startup unreliable or lacks proper validation
- ❌ Graceful shutdown doesn't work or leaves resources uncleaned
- ❌ Health monitoring incomplete or provides inaccurate status
- ❌ Performance criteria not met (startup >3s, shutdown >2s)
- ❌ Test passing below 100% or tests failing
