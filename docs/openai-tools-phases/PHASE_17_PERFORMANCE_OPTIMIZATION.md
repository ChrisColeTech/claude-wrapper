- **File Size Limits**: All files <200 lines, functions <50 lines, max 5 parameters
- **DRY Compliance**: Extract common performance patterns to PerformanceUtils
- **No Magic Values**: All performance values and thresholds in src/tools/constants.ts
- **Error Handling**: Consistent PerformanceError with specific performance metrics information
- **TypeScript Strict**: All performance optimizers code passes strict TypeScript compilation
- **Interface Design**: Maximum 5 methods per interface, single-purpose interfaces

### Anti-Pattern Prevention (MANDATORY)
- **No God Classes**: PerformanceOptimizer <200 lines, focused on performance optimization only
- **No Deep Nesting**: Maximum 3 levels in performance logic, use early returns
- **No Inline Complex Logic**: Extract optimization rules to named methods
- **No Hardcoded Values**: All performance configuration and thresholds in constants
- **No Magic Values**: Use PERF_LIMITS.CACHE_SIZE, OPTIMIZATION_MODES.AGGRESSIVE

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)
- **100% test coverage** for all performance optimization logic before proceeding to Phase 17B
- **Unit tests**: PerformanceOptimizer, caching system, profiler edge cases
- **Integration tests**: Performance optimization with complete tool processing

## Phase 17B: Performance Optimization - Comprehensive Review
**Goal**: Ensure 100% performance optimization compatibility and production-quality implementation
**Review Focus**: Performance gains, optimization effectiveness, resource efficiency
**Dependencies**: Phase 17A must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Standards**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_RULES.md`, `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`

### Comprehensive Review Requirements (MANDATORY)

#### 1. Performance Optimization Audit
- **Performance gains** must achieve 50% improvement in tool call processing
- **Optimization effectiveness** must be measurable and consistent
- **Resource efficiency** must reduce memory and CPU usage
- **Bottleneck resolution** must address all identified performance issues
- **Compatibility maintenance** must preserve functionality while optimizing

#### 2. Test Quality Review
- **Replace ALL placeholder tests** with real performance optimization functionality tests
- **Performance tests**: Test optimization effectiveness and speed improvements
- **Benchmark tests**: Test performance gains against baseline measurements
- **Resource tests**: Test memory and CPU usage optimization
