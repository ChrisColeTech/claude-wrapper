- **DRY Compliance**: Extract common test patterns to test utilities
- **No Magic Values**: All test data and expectations in fixtures/constants
- **Error Testing**: Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- **TypeScript Strict**: All test code passes strict TypeScript compilation
- **Test Organization**: Logical test grouping with clear naming conventions

### Anti-Pattern Prevention (MANDATORY)
- **No God Test Files**: Each test file <500 lines, focused on specific functionality
- **No Deep Test Nesting**: Maximum 3 levels in test structure, use clear descriptions
- **No Inline Complex Setup**: Extract test setup to helper functions
- **No Hardcoded Values**: All test data in fixtures or constants
- **No Magic Assertions**: Use descriptive assertion messages and helpers

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)
- **100% coverage** for all OpenAI tools functionality before proceeding to Phase 13B

## Phase 13B: OpenAI Tools Testing Integration - Comprehensive Review
**Goal**: Ensure 100% testing coverage and production-quality test implementation
**Review Focus**: Test comprehensiveness, performance validation, specification compliance
**Dependencies**: Phase 13A must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Standards**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_RULES.md`, `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`

### Comprehensive Review Requirements (MANDATORY)

#### 1. Testing Coverage Audit
- **OpenAI compatibility** must be verified through comprehensive test suite
- **Performance validation** must confirm all speed requirements met
- **Error scenario coverage** must test all failure modes and edge cases
- **Integration testing** must verify seamless operation with existing features
- **Specification compliance** must be validated against OpenAI documentation

#### 2. Test Quality Review
- **Replace ALL placeholder tests** with real functionality verification tests
- **Compatibility tests**: Verify OpenAI tools API specification compliance
- **Performance tests**: Validate all speed and efficiency requirements
- **Integration tests**: Test OpenAI tools with existing claude-wrapper features
- **Error scenario tests**: Test all error paths and recovery mechanisms
