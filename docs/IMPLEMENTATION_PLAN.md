# Implementation Plan - Claude Wrapper Rewrite

## üéØ Rewrite Strategy Overview

**Objective**: Transform the POC into a production-ready claude-wrapper by building upon the validated foundation and selectively integrating essential features from the original project (`/mnt/c/Projects/claude-wrapper/`).

**Approach**: Feature-driven phases where each phase implements one complete, testable feature while maintaining the POC's simplicity and avoiding over-engineering.

## üìã Phase-by-Phase Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Production Architecture Refactoring**
**Goal**: Transform POC codebase into production-ready architecture with proper separation of concerns.

üìã **[Complete Phase 1 Documentation](phases/rewrite-phases/PHASE_01_PRODUCTION_ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING.md)**

**Key Deliverables**:
- Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Professional error handling and logging
- All POC functionality preserved
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Production-ready code structure

---

### **Phase 2: CLI Interface Implementation**
**Goal**: Add command-line interface with proper CLI patterns, replacing the `npm start` approach.

üìã **[Complete Phase 2 Documentation](phases/rewrite-phases/PHASE_02_CLI_INTERFACE_IMPLEMENTATION.md)**

**Key Deliverables**:
- Full CLI interface with Commander.js
- Global installation support (`claude-wrapper` command)
- Interactive setup prompts
- Professional help documentation
- Background process management commands

---

### **Phase 3: Session Management Integration**
**Goal**: Add conversation continuity support for multi-turn conversations.

üìã **[Complete Phase 3 Documentation](phases/rewrite-phases/PHASE_03_SESSION_MANAGEMENT_INTEGRATION.md)**

**Key Deliverables**:
- Multi-turn conversation support
- Automatic session cleanup with TTL
- Session management API endpoints
- Memory-efficient storage
- Backward compatibility (stateless still works)

---

### **Phase 4: Streaming Support Implementation**
**Goal**: Add real-time response streaming with Server-Sent Events.

üìã **[Complete Phase 4 Documentation](phases/rewrite-phases/PHASE_04_STREAMING_SUPPORT_IMPLEMENTATION.md)**

**Key Deliverables**:
- Real-time response streaming with SSE
- Progressive tool call generation
- OpenAI streaming compatibility
- Robust connection management
- Stream error handling and recovery

---

### **Phase 5: HTTP API Protection**
**Goal**: Add optional bearer token authentication for HTTP endpoints.

üìã **[Complete Phase 5 Documentation](phases/rewrite-phases/PHASE_05_AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md)**

**Key Deliverables**:
- Optional HTTP API protection with bearer tokens
- Secure bearer token authentication middleware
- Constant-time comparison for security
- Selective endpoint protection (health/models always public)
- No Claude CLI authentication management (handled by Claude CLI directly)

---

### **Phase 6: Process Management Implementation**
**Goal**: Add background process management capabilities.

üìã **[Complete Phase 6 Documentation](phases/rewrite-phases/PHASE_06_PROCESS_MANAGEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md)**

**Key Deliverables**:
- Background process operation
- Graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
- Process health monitoring
- PID file management
- Production-ready process management

---

## üö´ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Based on analysis of the original project's over-engineering:

### **‚ùå Don't Implement These**
1. **18+ Interface Files** - Use direct class instantiation
2. **Factory Pattern Abstractions** - Simple constructors are clearer
3. **Dependency Injection Containers** - Constructor injection is sufficient
4. **Multiple Validation Middleware Layers** - Consolidate validation logic
5. **Complex Error Class Hierarchies** - Standard HTTP errors work fine
6. **Performance Monitoring Infrastructure** - Simple metrics are sufficient
7. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Linear request/response is simpler
8. **Resource Lifecycle Management** - Node.js handles garbage collection

### **‚úÖ Keep These Patterns**
1. **POC's Direct Approach** - Simple, readable code
2. **Template-Based Format Control** - Proven to work perfectly
3. **Zero-Conversion Architecture** - Direct JSON passthrough
4. **Client-Side Tool Execution** - Security and flexibility benefits
5. **Minimal Dependencies** - Easier maintenance and security
