# Phase 06A & 06B: Process Management Implementation

## Phase 06A: Process Management Implementation Implementation

**Goal**: Add background process management capabilities  
**Complete Feature**: Production-ready process management with daemon support  
**Dependencies**: Phase 05B must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Implementation**: claude-wrapper/app/src/process/manager.ts, claude-wrapper/app/src/process/daemon.ts, claude-wrapper/app/src/process/pid.ts, claude-wrapper/app/src/process/signals.ts
**Performance Requirement**: Process management operations <200ms

### Files to Create/Update

```
REFACTOR PATTERNS FROM ORIGINAL:
- Extract process management from claude-wrapper/app/src/process/manager.ts
- Extract daemon patterns from claude-wrapper/app/src/process/daemon.ts
- Extract PID handling from claude-wrapper/app/src/process/pid.ts
- Extract signal handling from claude-wrapper/app/src/process/signals.ts

CREATE NEW FILES:
- app/src/process/manager.ts (extract from claude-wrapper/app/src/process/manager.ts)
- app/src/process/daemon.ts (extract from claude-wrapper/app/src/process/daemon.ts)
- app/src/process/pid.ts (extract from claude-wrapper/app/src/process/pid.ts)
- app/src/process/signals.ts (extract from claude-wrapper/app/src/process/signals.ts)

CREATE TESTS:
- app/tests/unit/process/ - Process management unit tests
- app/tests/integration/process/ - Process integration tests

UPDATE EXISTING FILES:
- app/src/cli.ts - Add process management commands (pattern from claude-wrapper/app/src/cli.ts lines 200-250)
- app/src/cli/commands.ts - Add start/stop/status commands (pattern from claude-wrapper/app/src/cli/commands.ts)
- app/src/config/constants.ts - Add process management configuration (pattern from claude-wrapper/app/src/config/constants.ts)
```

### What Gets Implemented

- Implement background process management with PID file handling
- Add graceful shutdown handling for SIGTERM/SIGINT signals
- Support process health monitoring and status reporting
- Implement automatic restart on failure capabilities
- Add process lifecycle management (start, stop, status operations)
- Create daemon mode with proper process detachment
- Implement process monitoring and health checks
- Add process configuration management

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **SOLID Principles**:
  - **SRP**: ProcessManager handles only process management operations (<200 lines)
  - **OCP**: Extensible for new process management strategies via strategy pattern
  - **LSP**: All process handlers implement IProcessManager interface consistently
  - **ISP**: Separate interfaces for IProcessManager, IDaemonHandler, IPIDManager
  - **DIP**: Depend on Authentication and security abstractions from prior phases
- **File Size Limits**: All files <200 lines, functions <50 lines, max 5 parameters
- **DRY Compliance**: Extract common process management patterns to ProcessUtils
- **No Magic Values**: All process configuration values and management settings in app/src/config/constants.ts
- **Error Handling**: Consistent ProcessError with specific process management status information
- **TypeScript Strict**: All process handlers code passes strict TypeScript compilation
- **Interface Design**: Maximum 5 methods per interface, single-purpose interfaces

### Anti-Pattern Prevention (MANDATORY)

- **No God Classes**: ProcessManager <200 lines, focused on process management only
- **No Deep Nesting**: Maximum 3 levels in process logic, use early returns
- **No Inline Complex Logic**: Extract process handling rules to named methods
- **No Hardcoded Values**: All process configuration and lifecycle management in constants
- **No Magic Values**: Use PROCESS_CONFIG.PID_FILE_PATH, SIGNAL_HANDLERS.GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all process management logic before proceeding to Phase 06B
- **Unit tests**: ProcessManager, daemon handling, signal processing edge cases
- **Integration tests**: Process management with complete authentication integration
- **Mock objects**: Mock authentication services, process operations for testing
- **Error scenario tests**: Process startup failures, signal handling errors, PID file issues
- **Performance tests**: Process management operations <200ms

### Quality Gates for Phase 06A Completion

- ✅ All SOLID principles followed (verified via code review checklist)
- ✅ No anti-patterns present (ESLint max-lines, complexity, depth rules pass)
- ✅ 100% test passing achieved (Jest passing report)
- ✅ **All tests must pass** before proceeding to Phase 06B (unit + integration + performance)
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes (tsc --strict --noEmit)
- ✅ ESLint passes without warnings (npm run lint)
- ✅ process management demonstrable (integration test passing)
- ✅ Original project compatibility verified (process management maintains authentication functionality)
- ✅ Performance criteria met (process management operations <200ms)

### Original Project Compatibility Verification

- ✅ Background process management working
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling functional
- ✅ Process health monitoring working
- ✅ PID file management working correctly
- ✅ Start/stop/status commands functional

### Testable Features

- Background process management and daemon mode
- Graceful shutdown handling and signal processing
- Process health monitoring and status reporting
- PID file management and process lifecycle
- CLI process management commands

- **Ready for immediate demonstration** with process management examples

## Phase 06B: Process Management Implementation - Comprehensive Review

**Goal**: Ensure 100% process management compatibility and production-quality implementation
**Review Focus**: Process reliability, signal handling, lifecycle management
**Dependencies**: Phase 06A must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Standards**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, original claude-wrapper project

### Comprehensive Review Requirements (MANDATORY)

#### 1. Process Management Audit

- **Process reliability** must handle background operations correctly
- **Signal handling** must provide graceful shutdown
- **Lifecycle management** must handle start/stop/status correctly
- **Performance requirements** must achieve <200ms process operations
- **Health monitoring** must provide accurate process status

#### 2. Test Quality Review

- **Replace ALL placeholder tests** with real process management functionality tests
  - **Process tests**: Test background process management
- **Signal tests**: Test graceful shutdown and signal handling
- **Lifecycle tests**: Test process start/stop/status operations
- **Health tests**: Test process monitoring and status reporting
- **Performance tests**: Test process operation speed requirements

#### 3. Integration Validation

- **Authentication Integration**: Verify process management works with authentication
- **Daemon Integration**: Verify daemon mode works correctly
- **Signal Integration**: Verify signal handling works properly
- **CLI Integration**: Verify process management CLI commands

#### 4. Architecture Compliance Review

- **Single Responsibility**: process handlers components have single purposes
- **Dependency Injection**: ProcessManager depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Interface Segregation**: IProcessManager, IDaemonHandler, IPIDManager interfaces are focused (max 5 methods)
- **Error Handling**: Consistent ProcessError formatting
- **File Size Compliance**: All files under 200 lines, functions under 50 lines
- **DRY Compliance**: No duplicate process logic

#### 5. Performance Validation

- **Process operations**: <200ms for process management operations
- **Startup performance**: Fast process initialization and startup
- **Shutdown performance**: Fast graceful shutdown and cleanup
- **Monitoring performance**: Efficient process health monitoring

#### 6. Documentation Review

- **Process documentation**: Document process management patterns
- **Daemon guide**: Document daemon mode and background operations
- **Signal guide**: Document signal handling and graceful shutdown
- **CLI guide**: Document process management commands

### Quality Gates for Phase 06B Completion

- ✅ **100% process management functionality verified**
- ✅ **All process management tests are comprehensive and production-ready** - no placeholders
- ✅ **process management integrates correctly** with authentication with process management
- ✅ **Architecture compliance achieved** - SOLID/DRY principles followed, ESLint passes
- ✅ **Performance validation completed** - all speed requirements met (process management operations <200ms)
- ✅ **All tests must pass** before proceeding to Phase COMPLETEA (unit + integration + performance)
- ✅ **Documentation accuracy verified** - all docs reflect actual implementation

### Failure Criteria (Phase 06B Must Restart)

- ❌ Background process management not working
- ❌ Graceful shutdown broken or unreliable
- ❌ Performance criteria not met (operations >200ms)
- ❌ PID file management broken
- ❌ Process health monitoring inaccurate
- ❌ Test passing below 100% or tests failing
