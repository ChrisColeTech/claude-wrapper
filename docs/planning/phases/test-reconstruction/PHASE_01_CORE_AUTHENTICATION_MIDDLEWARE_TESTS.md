# Phase 01: Core Authentication Middleware Tests

**Goal**: Create comprehensive tests for bearer token authentication middleware with externalized mocks  
**Complete Feature**: Complete authentication middleware test suite with externalized mock architecture  
**Dependencies**: Phase 00 must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Implementation**: tests/mocks/auth/ directory, external mock patterns
**Performance Requirement**: Test execution time <5 seconds for all auth middleware tests

### Files to Create/Update

```
CREATE NEW TEST FILES:
- tests/unit/auth/middleware.test.ts - Authentication middleware comprehensive tests

CREATE NEW MOCK FILES:
- tests/mocks/auth/auth-mocks.ts - Express request/response mocks, auth utilities
- tests/mocks/shared/logger-mock.ts - Centralized logger mock (if not exists)

CREATE NEW MOCK TEST FILES:
- tests/mocks/auth/ - tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected
- tests/mocks/shared/- tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected

TEST COVERAGE:
- Bearer token validation and authentication flows
- Express middleware integration with mock req/res objects
- Error handling and response validation
- Case-insensitive header handling verification
- Authentication error types and codes testing
```

### What Gets Implemented

- Create comprehensive authentication middleware tests with externalized mocks
- Implement Express Request/Response mock objects in separate files
- Add bearer token validation test coverage for all scenarios
- Test case-insensitive header handling and edge cases
- Implement authentication error type validation
- Create reusable auth mock utilities for consistent testing
- Add comprehensive error handling and response testing
- Ensure no inline mocks within test files

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **Externalized Mock Architecture**: All mocks must be in separate files under `tests/mocks/`
- **No Inline Mocks**: Zero `jest.mock()` calls within test files
- **Reusable Mock Utilities**: Common mock patterns extracted to utilities
- **Mock Requirements**: External Express Request/Response mocks, logger mocks, auth utility mocks
- **Test Coverage**: Authentication middleware, bearer token validation, error handling edge cases
- **Mock Files**: tests/mocks/auth/auth-mocks.ts, tests/mocks/shared/logger-mock.ts
- **Test Files**: tests/unit/auth/middleware.test.ts
- **Error Scenarios**: Invalid tokens, malformed headers, missing authentication, case sensitivity
- **Feature Type**: authentication middleware testing

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all authentication middleware testing logic before proceeding to next phase
- **Externalized mocks only**: No inline mocking within test files
- **Mock organization**: All mocks properly organized in `tests/mocks/` directory
- **TypeScript strict**: All test and mock files pass strict TypeScript compilation
- **Performance**: Test execution time <5 seconds for all auth middleware tests

### Quality Gates for Phase 01 Completion

- ✅ All tests pass with externalized mock architecture
- ✅ No inline mocks present in test files
- ✅ Mock utilities are reusable and well-documented
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes for all test and mock files
- ✅ Test coverage meets requirements
- ✅ Performance requirements met (Test execution time <5 seconds for all auth middleware tests)
- ✅ Error scenarios properly tested

### Mock Architecture Requirements

- **Mock File Organization**: tests/mocks/auth/auth-mocks.ts, tests/mocks/shared/logger-mock.ts
- **Mock Setup Functions**: Each mock file exports setup/reset/create functions
- **Mock Utilities**: Reusable mock patterns for consistent testing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all mock interfaces
- **Performance**: Minimal impact from mock setup/teardown
