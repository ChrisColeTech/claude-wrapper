# Phase 03: Daemon Manager Tests

**Goal**: Create comprehensive tests for daemon process management with externalized mocks  
**Complete Feature**: Complete daemon management test suite with externalized mock architecture  
**Dependencies**: Phase 02 must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Implementation**: tests/mocks/process/ directory, daemon mock patterns
**Performance Requirement**: Test execution time <8 seconds for all daemon manager tests

### Files to Create/Update

```
CREATE NEW TEST FILES:
- tests/unit/process/daemon.test.ts - Daemon management comprehensive tests

CREATE NEW MOCK FILES:
- tests/mocks/process/daemon-child-process-mock.ts - Child process spawning and management
- tests/mocks/process/daemon-filesystem-mock.ts - File system operations for daemon scripts
- tests/mocks/process/daemon-os-mock.ts - OS-specific operations

CREATE NEW MOCK TEST FILES:
- tests/mocks/process/ - tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected
- tests/mocks/utils/- tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected

TEST COVERAGE:
- Daemon process spawning and lifecycle management
- Command line argument building and validation
- Process termination and cleanup procedures
- Status reporting and validation
- Script path resolution and configuration
- Error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
```

### What Gets Implemented

- Create comprehensive daemon manager tests with externalized mocks
- Implement child process spawn simulation and lifecycle testing
- Add command line argument building and validation tests
- Test daemon process termination and cleanup procedures
- Implement script path resolution and configuration testing
- Create reusable daemon mock utilities for consistent testing
- Add error scenario testing and recovery validation
- Ensure no inline mocks within test files

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **Externalized Mock Architecture**: All mocks must be in separate files under `tests/mocks/`
- **No Inline Mocks**: Zero `jest.mock()` calls within test files
- **Reusable Mock Utilities**: Common mock patterns extracted to utilities
- **Mock Requirements**: Child process spawn mocks, filesystem mocks, OS operation mocks
- **Test Coverage**: Daemon manager, process spawning, lifecycle management, error handling edge cases
- **Mock Files**: tests/mocks/process/daemon-child-process-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/daemon-filesystem-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/daemon-os-mock.ts
- **Test Files**: tests/unit/process/daemon.test.ts
- **Error Scenarios**: Spawn failures, script path errors, process termination issues
- **Feature Type**: daemon management testing

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all daemon management testing logic before proceeding to next phase
- **Externalized mocks only**: No inline mocking within test files
- **Mock organization**: All mocks properly organized in `tests/mocks/` directory
- **TypeScript strict**: All test and mock files pass strict TypeScript compilation
- **Performance**: Test execution time <8 seconds for all daemon manager tests

### Quality Gates for Phase 03 Completion

- ✅ All tests pass with externalized mock architecture
- ✅ No inline mocks present in test files
- ✅ Mock utilities are reusable and well-documented
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes for all test and mock files
- ✅ Test coverage meets requirements
- ✅ Performance requirements met (Test execution time <8 seconds for all daemon manager tests)
- ✅ Error scenarios properly tested

### Mock Architecture Requirements

- **Mock File Organization**: tests/mocks/process/daemon-child-process-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/daemon-filesystem-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/daemon-os-mock.ts
- **Mock Setup Functions**: Each mock file exports setup/reset/create functions
- **Mock Utilities**: Reusable mock patterns for consistent testing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all mock interfaces
- **Performance**: Minimal impact from mock setup/teardown
