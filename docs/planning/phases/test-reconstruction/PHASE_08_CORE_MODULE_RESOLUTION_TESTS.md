# Phase 08: Core Module Resolution Tests

**Goal**: Create comprehensive tests for core module resolution with externalized mocks  
**Complete Feature**: Complete module resolution test suite with externalized mock architecture  
**Dependencies**: Phase 07 must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Implementation**: tests/mocks/core/ directory, module resolution mock patterns
**Performance Requirement**: Test execution time <5 seconds for all module resolution tests

### Files to Create/Update

```
CREATE NEW TEST FILES:
- tests/unit/core/claude-resolver.test.ts - Module resolution comprehensive tests

CREATE NEW MOCK FILES:
- tests/mocks/core/claude-resolver-mock.ts - Module resolution utilities
- tests/mocks/core/claude-config-mock.ts - Configuration loading

CREATE NEW MOCK TEST FILES:
- tests/mocks/core/ - tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES TO MOCK:
- Must be investigated before starting the phase
- Check for reusable existing "external dependency" mock implementations in tests

TEST COVERAGE:
- Module resolution strategies and validation
- Configuration loading and validation procedures
- Error handling for missing modules and dependencies
- Environment-specific resolution and configuration
```

### What Gets Implemented

- Create comprehensive module resolution tests with externalized mocks
- Implement module loading simulation and validation testing
- Add configuration object mocking and loading procedures
- Test environment-specific resolution and configuration scenarios
- Implement error handling for missing modules and dependencies
- Create reusable module resolution mock utilities for consistent testing
- Add resolution strategy testing and validation procedures
- Ensure no inline mocks within test files

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **Externalized Mock Architecture**: All mocks must be in separate files under `tests/mocks/`
- **No Inline Mocks**: Zero `jest.mock()` calls within test files
- **Reusable Mock Utilities**: Common mock patterns extracted to utilities
- **Mock Requirements**: Module loading mocks, configuration object mocks, resolution strategy mocks
- **Test Coverage**: Module resolver, configuration loading, resolution strategies, error handling edge cases
- **Mock Files**: tests/mocks/core/claude-resolver-mock.ts, tests/mocks/core/claude-config-mock.ts
- **Test Files**: tests/unit/core/claude-resolver.test.ts
- **Error Scenarios**: Module loading failures, configuration errors, resolution conflicts
- **Feature Type**: module resolution testing

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all module resolution testing logic before proceeding to next phase
- **Externalized mocks only**: No inline mocking within test files
- **Mock organization**: All mocks properly organized in `tests/mocks/` directory
- **TypeScript strict**: All test and mock files pass strict TypeScript compilation
- **Performance**: Test execution time <5 seconds for all module resolution tests

### Quality Gates for Phase 08 Completion

- ✅ All tests pass with externalized mock architecture
- ✅ No inline mocks present in test files
- ✅ Mock utilities are reusable and well-documented
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes for all test and mock files
- ✅ Test coverage meets requirements
- ✅ Performance requirements met (Test execution time <5 seconds for all module resolution tests)
- ✅ Error scenarios properly tested

### Mock Architecture Requirements

- **Mock File Organization**: tests/mocks/core/claude-resolver-mock.ts, tests/mocks/core/claude-config-mock.ts
- **Mock Setup Functions**: Each mock file exports setup/reset/create functions
- **Mock Utilities**: Reusable mock patterns for consistent testing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all mock interfaces
- **Performance**: Minimal impact from mock setup/teardown
