# Phase 12: Authentication Providers Simple Tests

**Goal**: Create comprehensive tests for simple authentication providers with externalized mocks  
**Complete Feature**: Complete simple providers test suite with externalized mock architecture  
**Dependencies**: Phase 11 must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Implementation**: tests/mocks/auth/ directory, simple provider mock patterns
**Performance Requirement**: Test execution time <5 seconds for all simple provider tests

### Files to Create/Update

```
CREATE NEW TEST FILES:
- tests/unit/auth/providers-simple.test.ts - Simple providers comprehensive tests

CREATE NEW MOCK FILES:
- tests/mocks/auth/auth-providers-simple-mock.ts - Simple provider utilities

CREATE NEW MOCK TEST FILES:
- tests/mocks/auth/ - tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES TO MOCK:
- Must be investigated before starting the phase
- Check for reusable existing "external dependency" mock implementations in tests

TEST COVERAGE:
- Basic provider functionality and validation
- Simple provider configuration and setup
- Provider selection logic and processing
- Basic provider error handling and recovery
```

### What Gets Implemented

- Create comprehensive simple provider tests with externalized mocks
- Implement simple provider mocking and functionality testing
- Add basic provider configuration and setup procedures
- Test provider selection utilities and logic validation
- Implement basic error handling and recovery testing
- Create reusable simple provider mock utilities for consistent testing
- Add basic provider scenario testing and validation
- Ensure no inline mocks within test files

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **Externalized Mock Architecture**: All mocks must be in separate files under `tests/mocks/`
- **No Inline Mocks**: Zero `jest.mock()` calls within test files
- **Reusable Mock Utilities**: Common mock patterns extracted to utilities
- **Mock Requirements**: Simple provider mocks, basic configuration mocks, selection utility mocks
- **Test Coverage**: Simple providers, basic functionality, provider selection, error handling edge cases
- **Mock Files**: tests/mocks/auth/auth-providers-simple-mock.ts
- **Test Files**: tests/unit/auth/providers-simple.test.ts
- **Error Scenarios**: Provider functionality errors, configuration issues, selection failures
- **Feature Type**: simple provider testing

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all simple provider testing logic before proceeding to next phase
- **Externalized mocks only**: No inline mocking within test files
- **Mock organization**: All mocks properly organized in `tests/mocks/` directory
- **TypeScript strict**: All test and mock files pass strict TypeScript compilation
- **Performance**: Test execution time <5 seconds for all simple provider tests

### Quality Gates for Phase 12 Completion

- ✅ All tests pass with externalized mock architecture
- ✅ No inline mocks present in test files
- ✅ Mock utilities are reusable and well-documented
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes for all test and mock files
- ✅ Test coverage meets requirements
- ✅ Performance requirements met (Test execution time <5 seconds for all simple provider tests)
- ✅ Error scenarios properly tested

### Mock Architecture Requirements

- **Mock File Organization**: tests/mocks/auth/auth-providers-simple-mock.ts
- **Mock Setup Functions**: Each mock file exports setup/reset/create functions
- **Mock Utilities**: Reusable mock patterns for consistent testing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all mock interfaces
- **Performance**: Minimal impact from mock setup/teardown
