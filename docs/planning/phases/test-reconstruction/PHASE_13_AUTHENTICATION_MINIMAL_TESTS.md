# Phase 13: Authentication Minimal Tests

**Goal**: Create comprehensive tests for minimal authentication with externalized mocks  
**Complete Feature**: Complete minimal authentication test suite with externalized mock architecture  
**Dependencies**: Phase 12 must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Implementation**: tests/mocks/auth/ directory, minimal auth mock patterns
**Performance Requirement**: Test execution time <3 seconds for all minimal authentication tests

### Files to Create/Update

```
CREATE NEW TEST FILES:
- tests/unit/auth/minimal.test.ts - Minimal authentication comprehensive tests

CREATE NEW MOCK FILES:
- tests/mocks/auth/auth-minimal-mock.ts - Minimal auth utilities

CREATE NEW MOCK TEST FILES:
- tests/mocks/auth/ - tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES TO MOCK:
- Must be investigated before starting the phase
- Check for reusable existing "external dependency" mock implementations in tests

TEST COVERAGE:
- Minimal authentication setup and validation
- Basic auth validation and processing
- Simple auth flows and procedures
- Minimal configuration testing and validation
```

### What Gets Implemented

- Create comprehensive minimal authentication tests with externalized mocks
- Implement minimal mock setup and authentication testing
- Add basic auth utilities and validation procedures
- Test simple validation mocking and auth flow scenarios
- Implement minimal configuration testing and validation
- Create reusable minimal auth mock utilities for consistent testing
- Add minimal authentication scenario testing and validation
- Ensure no inline mocks within test files

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **Externalized Mock Architecture**: All mocks must be in separate files under `tests/mocks/`
- **No Inline Mocks**: Zero `jest.mock()` calls within test files
- **Reusable Mock Utilities**: Common mock patterns extracted to utilities
- **Mock Requirements**: Minimal mock setup, basic auth utilities, simple validation mocks
- **Test Coverage**: Minimal auth, basic validation, simple flows, configuration testing edge cases
- **Mock Files**: tests/mocks/auth/auth-minimal-mock.ts
- **Test Files**: tests/unit/auth/minimal.test.ts
- **Error Scenarios**: Minimal setup failures, basic validation errors, flow issues
- **Feature Type**: minimal authentication testing

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all minimal authentication testing logic before proceeding to next phase
- **Externalized mocks only**: No inline mocking within test files
- **Mock organization**: All mocks properly organized in `tests/mocks/` directory
- **TypeScript strict**: All test and mock files pass strict TypeScript compilation
- **Performance**: Test execution time <3 seconds for all minimal authentication tests

### Quality Gates for Phase 13 Completion

- ✅ All tests pass with externalized mock architecture
- ✅ No inline mocks present in test files
- ✅ Mock utilities are reusable and well-documented
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes for all test and mock files
- ✅ Test coverage meets requirements
- ✅ Performance requirements met (Test execution time <3 seconds for all minimal authentication tests)
- ✅ Error scenarios properly tested

### Mock Architecture Requirements

- **Mock File Organization**: tests/mocks/auth/auth-minimal-mock.ts
- **Mock Setup Functions**: Each mock file exports setup/reset/create functions
- **Mock Utilities**: Reusable mock patterns for consistent testing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all mock interfaces
- **Performance**: Minimal impact from mock setup/teardown
