# Phase 05: Process Signal Handler Tests

**Goal**: Create comprehensive tests for process signal handling with externalized mocks  
**Complete Feature**: Complete signal handling test suite with externalized mock architecture  
**Dependencies**: Phase 04 must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Implementation**: tests/mocks/process/ directory, signal mock patterns
**Performance Requirement**: Test execution time <7 seconds for all signal handler tests

### Files to Create/Update

```
CREATE NEW TEST FILES:
- tests/unit/process/signals.test.ts - Signal handling comprehensive tests

CREATE NEW MOCK FILES:
- tests/mocks/process/signal-process-mock.ts - Process signal handling
- tests/mocks/process/signal-server-mock.ts - Server shutdown simulation
- tests/mocks/process/signal-session-mock.ts - Session manager shutdown

CREATE NEW MOCK TEST FILES:
- tests/mocks/process/ - tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected
- tests/mocks/utils/- tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES TO MOCK:
- Must be investigated before starting the phase
- Check for reusable existing "external dependency" mock implementations in tests

TEST COVERAGE:
- Graceful shutdown signal handling and processing
- Multi-step shutdown process coordination
- Timeout handling for shutdown steps
- Error recovery during shutdown procedures
- Signal registration and cleanup operations
```

### What Gets Implemented

- Create comprehensive signal handler tests with externalized mocks
- Implement process signal event simulation and testing
- Add server shutdown operation mocking and validation
- Test multi-step shutdown process coordination
- Implement timeout and error scenario handling tests
- Create reusable signal mock utilities for consistent testing
- Add graceful shutdown and cleanup validation tests
- Ensure no inline mocks within test files

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **Externalized Mock Architecture**: All mocks must be in separate files under `tests/mocks/`
- **No Inline Mocks**: Zero `jest.mock()` calls within test files
- **Reusable Mock Utilities**: Common mock patterns extracted to utilities
- **Mock Requirements**: Process signal mocks, server shutdown mocks, session manager mocks
- **Test Coverage**: Signal handler, graceful shutdown, multi-step processes, error handling edge cases
- **Mock Files**: tests/mocks/process/signal-process-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/signal-server-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/signal-session-mock.ts
- **Test Files**: tests/unit/process/signals.test.ts
- **Error Scenarios**: Signal handling failures, shutdown timeouts, cleanup errors
- **Feature Type**: signal handling testing

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all signal handling testing logic before proceeding to next phase
- **Externalized mocks only**: No inline mocking within test files
- **Mock organization**: All mocks properly organized in `tests/mocks/` directory
- **TypeScript strict**: All test and mock files pass strict TypeScript compilation
- **Performance**: Test execution time <7 seconds for all signal handler tests

### Quality Gates for Phase 05 Completion

- ✅ All tests pass with externalized mock architecture
- ✅ No inline mocks present in test files
- ✅ Mock utilities are reusable and well-documented
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes for all test and mock files
- ✅ Test coverage meets requirements
- ✅ Performance requirements met (Test execution time <7 seconds for all signal handler tests)
- ✅ Error scenarios properly tested

### Mock Architecture Requirements

- **Mock File Organization**: tests/mocks/process/signal-process-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/signal-server-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/signal-session-mock.ts
- **Mock Setup Functions**: Each mock file exports setup/reset/create functions
- **Mock Utilities**: Reusable mock patterns for consistent testing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all mock interfaces
- **Performance**: Minimal impact from mock setup/teardown
