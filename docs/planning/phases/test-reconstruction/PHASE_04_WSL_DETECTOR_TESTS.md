# Phase 04: WSL Detector Tests

**Goal**: Create comprehensive tests for WSL environment detection with externalized mocks  
**Complete Feature**: Complete WSL detection test suite with externalized mock architecture  
**Dependencies**: Phase 03 must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Implementation**: tests/mocks/utils/ directory, WSL mock patterns
**Performance Requirement**: Test execution time <6 seconds for all WSL detector tests

### Files to Create/Update

```
CREATE NEW TEST FILES:
- tests/unit/utils/wsl-detector.test.ts - WSL detection comprehensive tests

CREATE NEW MOCK FILES:
- tests/mocks/utils/wsl-filesystem-mock.ts - /proc filesystem simulation
- tests/mocks/utils/wsl-network-mock.ts - Network command execution
- tests/mocks/utils/wsl-environment-mock.ts - Environment variable management

CREATE NEW MOCK TEST FILES:
- tests/mocks/process/ - tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected
- tests/mocks/utils/- tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES TO MOCK:
- Must be investigated before starting the phase
- Check for reusable existing "external dependency" mock implementations in tests

TEST COVERAGE:
- WSL environment detection methods and validation
- IP address resolution and format validation
- WSL version detection (WSL1 vs WSL2)
- Network availability checking and timeout handling
- Error handling for filesystem and network operations
- Environment variable processing and validation
```

### What Gets Implemented

- Create comprehensive WSL detector tests with externalized mocks
- Implement filesystem simulation for /proc file operations
- Add network command execution mocking and testing
- Test IP address resolution and validation procedures
- Implement WSL version detection and environment testing
- Create reusable WSL mock utilities for consistent testing
- Add error scenario testing for filesystem and network operations
- Ensure no inline mocks within test files

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **Externalized Mock Architecture**: All mocks must be in separate files under `tests/mocks/`
- **No Inline Mocks**: Zero `jest.mock()` calls within test files
- **Reusable Mock Utilities**: Common mock patterns extracted to utilities
- **Mock Requirements**: Filesystem operation mocks, network command mocks, environment variable mocks
- **Test Coverage**: WSL detector, environment detection, network operations, error handling edge cases
- **Mock Files**: tests/mocks/utils/wsl-filesystem-mock.ts, tests/mocks/utils/wsl-network-mock.ts, tests/mocks/utils/wsl-environment-mock.ts
- **Test Files**: tests/unit/utils/wsl-detector.test.ts
- **Error Scenarios**: Filesystem read errors, network timeouts, invalid environment variables
- **Feature Type**: WSL detection testing

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all WSL detection testing logic before proceeding to next phase
- **Externalized mocks only**: No inline mocking within test files
- **Mock organization**: All mocks properly organized in `tests/mocks/` directory
- **TypeScript strict**: All test and mock files pass strict TypeScript compilation
- **Performance**: Test execution time <6 seconds for all WSL detector tests

### Quality Gates for Phase 04 Completion

- ✅ All tests pass with externalized mock architecture
- ✅ No inline mocks present in test files
- ✅ Mock utilities are reusable and well-documented
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes for all test and mock files
- ✅ Test coverage meets requirements
- ✅ Performance requirements met (Test execution time <6 seconds for all WSL detector tests)
- ✅ Error scenarios properly tested

### Mock Architecture Requirements

- **Mock File Organization**: tests/mocks/utils/wsl-filesystem-mock.ts, tests/mocks/utils/wsl-network-mock.ts, tests/mocks/utils/wsl-environment-mock.ts
- **Mock Setup Functions**: Each mock file exports setup/reset/create functions
- **Mock Utilities**: Reusable mock patterns for consistent testing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all mock interfaces
- **Performance**: Minimal impact from mock setup/teardown
