# Phase 02: Process Manager Tests

**Goal**: Create comprehensive tests for process management with externalized dynamic import mocks  
**Complete Feature**: Complete process management test suite with externalized mock architecture  
**Dependencies**: Phase 01 must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Implementation**: tests/mocks/process/ directory, dynamic import mock patterns
**Performance Requirement**: Test execution time <10 seconds for all process manager tests

### Files to Create/Update

```
CREATE NEW TEST FILES:
- tests/unit/process/manager.test.ts - Process management comprehensive tests

CREATE NEW MOCK FILES:
- tests/mocks/process/child-process-mock.ts - Handle dynamic imports for health checks
- tests/mocks/process/daemon-manager-mock.ts - Daemon lifecycle operations
- tests/mocks/process/pid-manager-mock.ts - PID file operations
- tests/mocks/process/signal-handler-mock.ts - Signal handling operations
- tests/mocks/utils/wsl-mock.ts - WSL detection and port forwarding

CREATE NEW MOCK TEST FILES:
- tests/mocks/process/ - tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected
- tests/mocks/utils/- tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected

TEST COVERAGE:
- Process lifecycle management (start/stop/restart/status)
- Health check functionality with dynamic import mocking
- Error handling and recovery scenarios
- Performance monitoring for startup/shutdown times
- WSL integration and port forwarding cleanup
- PID management integration testing
```

### What Gets Implemented

- Create comprehensive process manager tests with externalized mocks
- Implement dynamic import handling for child_process and util modules
- Add health check functionality testing with proper mock isolation
- Test complex state management for process lifecycle operations
- Implement WSL environment simulation and testing
- Create reusable process mock utilities for consistent testing
- Add performance monitoring and timing validation tests
- Ensure no inline mocks within test files

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **Externalized Mock Architecture**: All mocks must be in separate files under `tests/mocks/`
- **No Inline Mocks**: Zero `jest.mock()` calls within test files
- **Reusable Mock Utilities**: Common mock patterns extracted to utilities
- **Mock Requirements**: Dynamic import mocks, child process mocks, PID manager mocks, daemon mocks
- **Test Coverage**: Process manager, health checks, lifecycle management, WSL integration edge cases
- **Mock Files**: tests/mocks/process/child-process-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/daemon-manager-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/pid-manager-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/signal-handler-mock.ts, tests/mocks/utils/wsl-mock.ts
- **Test Files**: tests/unit/process/manager.test.ts
- **Error Scenarios**: Process startup failures, health check timeouts, WSL configuration errors
- **Feature Type**: process management testing

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all process management testing logic before proceeding to next phase
- **Externalized mocks only**: No inline mocking within test files
- **Mock organization**: All mocks properly organized in `tests/mocks/` directory
- **TypeScript strict**: All test and mock files pass strict TypeScript compilation
- **Performance**: Test execution time <10 seconds for all process manager tests

### Quality Gates for Phase 02 Completion

- ✅ All tests pass with externalized mock architecture
- ✅ No inline mocks present in test files
- ✅ Mock utilities are reusable and well-documented
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes for all test and mock files
- ✅ Test coverage meets requirements
- ✅ Performance requirements met (Test execution time <10 seconds for all process manager tests)
- ✅ Error scenarios properly tested

### Mock Architecture Requirements

- **Mock File Organization**: tests/mocks/process/child-process-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/daemon-manager-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/pid-manager-mock.ts, tests/mocks/process/signal-handler-mock.ts, tests/mocks/utils/wsl-mock.ts
- **Mock Setup Functions**: Each mock file exports setup/reset/create functions
- **Mock Utilities**: Reusable mock patterns for consistent testing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all mock interfaces
- **Performance**: Minimal impact from mock setup/teardown
