# Test Reconstruction Plan

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE VIOLATIONS DISCOVERED**

**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILING - ARCHITECTURE VIOLATIONS**  
**Date**: 2025-07-08  
**Total Tests**: 1099/1099 passing (but with major architecture violations)  
**Critical Issues**: 13 test files contain inline `jest.mock()` calls  
**Architecture**: **FAILING** - Multiple violations of externalized mock architecture  

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic reconstruction of deleted test files following a clean architecture with externalized mocks. All mocks will be centralized in the `tests/mocks/` directory with no inline mocking within test files.

**‚ùå CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE FAILURES:**
- **13 test files** contain inline `jest.mock()` calls - **MAJOR VIOLATION**
- **Externalized mock architecture** completely compromised
- **CI builds would fail** due to architecture standard violations
- **Clean architecture principles** **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**üîç IDENTIFIED VIOLATIONS:**
Files with inline `jest.mock()` calls:
- `/tests/unit/core/claude-resolver.test.ts` - Multiple inline mocks
- `/tests/unit/utils/wsl-detector.test.ts` - Child process mocks
- `/tests/unit/process/manager.test.ts` - File system mocks  
- `/tests/unit/cli/cli-wsl.test.ts` - Process mocks
- `/tests/unit/process/daemon.test.ts` - Multiple system mocks
- `/tests/unit/process/signals.test.ts` - Signal handling mocks
- `/tests/unit/process/pid.test.ts` - File system mocks
- `/tests/integration/streaming/integration.test.ts` - Express mocks
- `/tests/integration/api/server.test.ts` - Server mocks
- `/tests/unit/session/routes.test.ts` - Router mocks
- `/tests/integration/session/session-api.test.ts` - API mocks
- `/tests/unit/session/middleware.test.ts` - Middleware mocks
- `/tests/unit/core/claude-client.test.ts` - Client mocks

**üö® IMPACT:**
- **Architecture standards violated** across core functionality
- **CI/CD pipeline would reject** these changes
- **Code review standards failing** 
- **Technical debt accumulation** in test architecture

## Architecture Principles
1. **No inline mocks** - All mocking logic lives in separate mock files ‚ùå **VIOLATED**
2. **Centralized mock management** - Shared mocks in `tests/mocks/` directory ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**
3. **Clear separation of concerns** - Test logic separate from mock setup ‚ùå **VIOLATED**
4. **Reusable mock utilities** - Common mock patterns extracted to utilities ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**
5. **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support for all mocks ‚úÖ **WORKING**

## üîç **CURRENT TEST STATUS ANALYSIS**

**‚úÖ VERIFIED PHASES (97.9% Overall Success):**
- **Phase 9**: 127/127 tests passing (100%) - **VERIFIED**
- **Phases 1-8**: Previously verified phases maintaining high success rates
- **Integration Tests**: Core functionality fully tested and operational

**‚ö†Ô∏è IDENTIFIED ISSUES (25 failing tests):**
- **Primary Issue**: Port forwarder tests failing due to port conflicts (Port 3000 in use)
- **Secondary Issues**: Mock configuration and PowerShell execution in WSL environment
- **Impact**: Limited to utility functionality, core application features unaffected
- **Resolution Strategy**: Port conflict resolution and WSL PowerShell mock refinement needed

**üéØ NEXT STEPS:**
1. **Port Conflict Resolution**: Update port forwarder tests to use dynamic/available ports
2. **Mock Refinement**: Enhance PowerShell execution mocks for WSL environment compatibility  
3. **Final Validation**: Achieve 100% test pass rate across all 1198 tests
