# Phase 09: Authentication Debug Tests

**Goal**: Create comprehensive tests for authentication debugging with externalized mocks  
**Complete Feature**: Complete authentication debug test suite with externalized mock architecture  
**Dependencies**: Phase 08 must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Implementation**: tests/mocks/auth/ directory, debug mock patterns
**Performance Requirement**: Test execution time <4 seconds for all authentication debug tests

### Files to Create/Update

```
CREATE NEW TEST FILES:
- tests/unit/auth/debug.test.ts - Authentication debugging comprehensive tests

CREATE NEW MOCK FILES:
- tests/mocks/auth/auth-debug-mock.ts - Debug-specific auth utilities

CREATE NEW MOCK TEST FILES:
- tests/mocks/auth/ - tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES TO MOCK:
- Must be investigated before starting the phase
- Check for reusable existing "external dependency" mock implementations in tests

TEST COVERAGE:
- Authentication debugging utilities and validation
- Token validation debugging and troubleshooting
- Error diagnostic information and reporting
- Debug logging integration and validation
```

### What Gets Implemented

- Create comprehensive authentication debug tests with externalized mocks
- Implement debug output capture and validation testing
- Add token manipulation utilities and debugging procedures
- Test error simulation and diagnostic information reporting
- Implement debug logging integration and validation testing
- Create reusable auth debug mock utilities for consistent testing
- Add debugging scenario testing and validation procedures
- Ensure no inline mocks within test files

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **Externalized Mock Architecture**: All mocks must be in separate files under `tests/mocks/`
- **No Inline Mocks**: Zero `jest.mock()` calls within test files
- **Reusable Mock Utilities**: Common mock patterns extracted to utilities
- **Mock Requirements**: Debug output capture mocks, token manipulation mocks, error simulation mocks
- **Test Coverage**: Auth debugging, token validation, error diagnostics, logging integration edge cases
- **Mock Files**: tests/mocks/auth/auth-debug-mock.ts
- **Test Files**: tests/unit/auth/debug.test.ts
- **Error Scenarios**: Debug output failures, token manipulation errors, logging issues
- **Feature Type**: authentication debugging testing

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all authentication debugging testing logic before proceeding to next phase
- **Externalized mocks only**: No inline mocking within test files
- **Mock organization**: All mocks properly organized in `tests/mocks/` directory
- **TypeScript strict**: All test and mock files pass strict TypeScript compilation
- **Performance**: Test execution time <4 seconds for all authentication debug tests

### Quality Gates for Phase 09 Completion

- ✅ All tests pass with externalized mock architecture
- ✅ No inline mocks present in test files
- ✅ Mock utilities are reusable and well-documented
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes for all test and mock files
- ✅ Test coverage meets requirements
- ✅ Performance requirements met (Test execution time <4 seconds for all authentication debug tests)
- ✅ Error scenarios properly tested

### Mock Architecture Requirements

- **Mock File Organization**: tests/mocks/auth/auth-debug-mock.ts
- **Mock Setup Functions**: Each mock file exports setup/reset/create functions
- **Mock Utilities**: Reusable mock patterns for consistent testing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all mock interfaces
- **Performance**: Minimal impact from mock setup/teardown
