# Phase 15: Authentication Basic Integration Tests

**Goal**: Create comprehensive basic authentication integration tests with externalized mocks  
**Complete Feature**: Complete basic auth integration test suite with externalized mock architecture  
**Dependencies**: Phase 14 must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Implementation**: tests/mocks/integration/ directory, basic integration mock patterns
**Performance Requirement**: Test execution time <8 seconds for all basic integration tests

### Files to Create/Update

```
CREATE NEW TEST FILES:
- tests/integration/auth/basic-auth.test.ts - Basic auth integration comprehensive tests

CREATE NEW MOCK FILES:
- tests/mocks/integration/auth-basic-mock.ts - Basic auth integration mocking

CREATE NEW MOCK TEST FILES:
- tests/mocks/auth/ - tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected
- tests/mocks/integration/- tests for the mocks to ensure the mocks works as expected

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES TO MOCK:
- Must be investigated before starting the phase
- Check for reusable existing "external dependency" mock implementations in tests

TEST COVERAGE:
- Basic authentication integration flows and validation
- End-to-end auth validation and processing
- Request/response integration and testing
- Error handling integration and validation
```

### What Gets Implemented

- Create comprehensive basic auth integration tests with externalized mocks
- Implement HTTP request/response simulation and integration testing
- Add full auth flow mocking and end-to-end validation
- Test integration error scenarios and handling procedures
- Implement request/response integration and validation testing
- Create reusable basic integration mock utilities for consistent testing
- Add integration flow testing and validation procedures
- Ensure no inline mocks within test files

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **Externalized Mock Architecture**: All mocks must be in separate files under `tests/mocks/`
- **No Inline Mocks**: Zero `jest.mock()` calls within test files
- **Reusable Mock Utilities**: Common mock patterns extracted to utilities
- **Mock Requirements**: HTTP request/response mocks, full auth flow mocks, integration error mocks
- **Test Coverage**: Basic auth integration, end-to-end flows, request/response handling, error integration edge cases
- **Mock Files**: tests/mocks/integration/auth-basic-mock.ts
- **Test Files**: tests/integration/auth/basic-auth.test.ts
- **Error Scenarios**: Integration flow failures, request/response errors, auth validation issues
- **Feature Type**: basic authentication integration testing

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all basic authentication integration testing logic before proceeding to next phase
- **Externalized mocks only**: No inline mocking within test files
- **Mock organization**: All mocks properly organized in `tests/mocks/` directory
- **TypeScript strict**: All test and mock files pass strict TypeScript compilation
- **Performance**: Test execution time <8 seconds for all basic integration tests

### Quality Gates for Phase 15 Completion

- ✅ All tests pass with externalized mock architecture
- ✅ No inline mocks present in test files
- ✅ Mock utilities are reusable and well-documented
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes for all test and mock files
- ✅ Test coverage meets requirements
- ✅ Performance requirements met (Test execution time <8 seconds for all basic integration tests)
- ✅ Error scenarios properly tested

### Mock Architecture Requirements

- **Mock File Organization**: tests/mocks/integration/auth-basic-mock.ts
- **Mock Setup Functions**: Each mock file exports setup/reset/create functions
- **Mock Utilities**: Reusable mock patterns for consistent testing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all mock interfaces
- **Performance**: Minimal impact from mock setup/teardown
