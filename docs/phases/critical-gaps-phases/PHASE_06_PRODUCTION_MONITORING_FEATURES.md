```

### What Gets Implemented

- Real-time performance monitoring with request metrics and timing
- Automated session cleanup service with configurable intervals and statistics
- Request timing middleware for endpoint performance tracking
- Monitoring API endpoints for operational visibility and metrics
- Memory and resource usage tracking with alerting thresholds
- Performance trend analysis and reporting
- Cleanup operation scheduling and monitoring
- Operational dashboard data collection and formatting

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **SOLID Principles**:
  - **SRP**: PerformanceMonitor handles only metrics collection operations (<200 lines)
  - **OCP**: Extensible for new monitoring strategies via strategy pattern
  - **LSP**: All monitoring services implement IPerformanceMonitor interface consistently
  - **ISP**: Separate interfaces for ICleanupService, ITimingMiddleware
  - **DIP**: Depend on IModelValidator from Phase 05 and validation abstractions from prior phases
- **File Size Limits**: All files <200 lines, functions <50 lines, max 5 parameters
- **DRY Compliance**: Extract common monitoring and cleanup patterns to MonitoringUtils
- **No Magic numbers**: All monitoring intervals and performance thresholds in src/claude/constants.ts
- **Error Handling**: Consistent MonitoringError with specific monitoring operation status and performance data
- **TypeScript Strict**: All monitoring services code passes strict TypeScript compilation
- **Interface Design**: Maximum 5 methods per interface, single-purpose interfaces

### Anti-Pattern Prevention (MANDATORY)

- **No God Classes**: PerformanceMonitor <200 lines, focused on production monitoring and cleanup only
- **No Deep Nesting**: Maximum 3 levels in monitoring logic, use early returns
- **No Inline Complex Logic**: Extract performance tracking rules to named methods
- **No Hardcoded Values**: All monitoring configuration and cleanup schedules in constants
- **No Magic numbers**: Use CLEANUP_INTERVALS.DEFAULT, PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS.WARNING

### Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

- **100% test passing** for all production monitoring features logic before proceeding to Phase 06B
- **Unit tests**: Performance monitor, cleanup service, timing middleware edge cases
- **Integration tests**: Complete monitoring system with session cleanup and performance tracking
- **Mock objects**: Mock system resources for testing, real monitoring for integration
- **Error scenario tests**: Monitoring failures, cleanup errors, performance threshold breaches
- **Performance tests**: Monitoring overhead <5ms, cleanup operations <500ms

### Quality Gates for Phase 06A Completion

- ✅ All SOLID principles followed (verified via code review checklist)
- ✅ No anti-patterns present (ESLint max-lines, complexity, depth rules pass)
- ✅ 100% test passing achieved (Jest passing report)

## Phase 06B: Production Monitoring Features - Comprehensive Review

**Goal**: Ensure 100% production monitoring features compatibility and production-quality implementation
**Review Focus**: Accuracy, performance, and operational value
**Dependencies**: Phase 06A must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**Reference Standards**: `docs/CLAUDE_SDK_REFERENCE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_RULES.md`

### Comprehensive Review Requirements (MANDATORY)

#### 1. Production Monitoring System Audit Audit

- **Accuracy**: Monitoring metrics must be accurate and reliable.
- **Performance**: Monitoring system must have minimal performance overhead.
- **Operational Value**: Monitoring data must be valuable for production operations.
- **Parity**: Session cleanup must match Python behavior.

#### 2. Test Quality Review

- **Replace ALL placeholder tests** with real production monitoring features functionality tests
- **Metrics Accuracy Tests**: Verify the accuracy of collected metrics.
- **Cleanup Logic Tests**: Test session cleanup logic and scheduling.
- **API Endpoint Tests**: Verify monitoring API endpoints return correct data.
- **Performance Tests**: Measure the performance overhead of the monitoring system.

#### 3. Integration Validation

- **Middleware Integration**: Ensure monitoring middleware is correctly integrated.
- **Session Manager Integration**: Verify session cleanup is correctly integrated.
- **Health Check Integration**: Ensure monitoring data is included in health checks.

#### 4. Architecture Compliance Review

- **Single Responsibility**: monitoring services components have single purposes
- **Dependency Injection**: PerformanceMonitor depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Interface Segregation**: ICleanupService, ITimingMiddleware interfaces are focused (max 5 methods)
- **Error Handling**: Consistent MonitoringError formatting
- **File Size Compliance**: All files under 200 lines, functions under 50 lines
- **DRY Compliance**: No duplicate monitoring logic

#### 5. Performance Validation

- **Monitoring Overhead**: <5ms per request.
- **Cleanup Operations**: <500ms to complete.
- **API Response Time**: <100ms for monitoring endpoints.

#### 6. Documentation Review

- **Monitoring Guide**: Document how to use the monitoring features.
- **API Reference**: Document the monitoring API endpoints.
- **Cleanup Guide**: Document the session cleanup service.

### Quality Gates for Phase 06B Completion
