# Phase 25A & 25B: Production Memory Management

## Phase 25A: Production Memory Management Implementation
**Goal**: Fix memory leaks that will crash long-running production deployments  
**Complete Feature**: Bounded collections and proper resource cleanup to prevent memory exhaustion  
**Dependencies**: Phase 24B must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**OpenAI Reference**: Based on production stability requirements for long-running API services
**Performance Requirement**: Memory usage stable <1GB, cleanup cycles <10ms, no memory leaks

### What Gets Implemented
- Fix unbounded accessCounts map with LRU eviction mechanism
- Add memory leak detection and bounded metrics storage
- Implement proper session cleanup with resource limits
- All maps and arrays must have maximum size limits
- Explicit lifecycle management for all resources (RAII pattern)
- Memory usage tracking and alerts for leak detection
- Bounded collections prevent unlimited growth
- Named constants for all memory management configurations

### Architecture Compliance Requirements (MANDATORY)
- **SOLID Principles**: 
  - **SRP**: MemoryManager handles only memory usage tracking (<200 lines)
  - **OCP**: Extensible for new memory management via strategy pattern
  - **LSP**: All memory handlers implement IMemoryManager interface consistently
  - **ISP**: Separate interfaces for ILRUCache, IResourceCleaner, IBoundedCollections
  - **DIP**: Depend on ICache interface for different storage strategies from prior phases
- **File Size Limits**: All files <200 lines, functions <50 lines, max 5 parameters
- **DRY Compliance**: Extract common memory management patterns to MemoryManagementUtils
- **No Magic Values**: All memory management values in src/tools/constants.ts
- **Error Handling**: Consistent MemoryManagementError with specific memory management status information
- **TypeScript Strict**: All memory handlers code passes strict TypeScript compilation
- **Interface Design**: Maximum 5 methods per interface, single-purpose interfaces

### Anti-Pattern Prevention (MANDATORY)
- **No God Classes**: MemoryManager <200 lines, focused on memory management only
- **No Deep Nesting**: Maximum 3 levels in memory management logic, use early returns
- **No Inline Complex Logic**: Extract memory cleanup and tracking rules to named methods
- **No Hardcoded Values**: All memory management configuration in constants
- **No Direct Dependencies**: Use dependency injection for all external dependencies

### Testing Requirements (100% Complete & Passing)
- **Unit Tests**: MemoryManager, LRU cache, bounded collections, cleanup services edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: Memory management integration with long-running scenarios
- **Mock Requirements**: Mock memory monitoring, simulated memory pressure for integration tests
- **Error Scenarios**: Memory leaks, cleanup failures, collection overflow, resource exhaustion
- **Performance Tests**: Memory usage stable <1GB, cleanup cycles <10ms, no memory leaks
- **NO PLACEHOLDER TESTS**: All tests validate real memory management functionality, no mock stubs

### Performance Requirements (MANDATORY)
**memory management maintains application performance and stability**
- **Performance Criteria**: memory usage stable <1GB, cleanup cycles <10ms, no memory leaks

### OpenAI Compatibility Checklist (MANDATORY)
- ‚úÖ Memory usage remains stable under continuous operation
- ‚úÖ LRU eviction prevents unbounded collection growth
- ‚úÖ Resource cleanup properly releases all allocated resources
- ‚úÖ Memory leak detection identifies and reports issues
- ‚úÖ Performance remains stable with memory management active

### Testable Features Checklist (MANDATORY)
- Memory usage remains stable under long-running operation
- LRU eviction correctly limits collection sizes
- Resource cleanup releases all allocated memory and handles
- Memory leak detection identifies actual leaks
- Performance meets stability requirements with memory management

## Phase 25B: Production Memory Management Review & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Review Requirements
This phase conducts thorough review of Phase 25A implementation with the following mandatory checks:

### 1. OpenAI Compatibility Audit
**Production Memory Management Audit Requirements**:
- **Memory stability** must prevent memory exhaustion in production
- **LRU eviction** must limit all collection sizes correctly
- **Resource cleanup** must release all allocated resources
- **Leak detection** must identify and report memory leaks
- **Performance** must maintain stability with memory management active

### 2. Test Quality Review  
**Test Review Requirements**:
- **Stability tests**: Test memory usage under long-running scenarios
- **Eviction tests**: Test LRU eviction and bounded collections
- **Cleanup tests**: Test resource cleanup and release
- **Leak tests**: Test memory leak detection and reporting
- **Performance tests**: Test memory management performance impact

### 3. Integration Validation
**Integration Validation Requirements**:
- **Application Integration**: Verify memory management works with all components
- **Monitoring Integration**: Verify integration with system monitoring
- **Cleanup Integration**: Verify resource cleanup works across all services
- **Performance Integration**: Verify memory management doesn't impact performance

### 4. Architecture Compliance Review
- ‚úÖ **SOLID Principles**: All components follow SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP correctly
- ‚úÖ **File Size Compliance**: All files <200 lines, functions <50 lines
- ‚úÖ **DRY Compliance**: No code duplication >3 lines, extracted to utilities
- ‚úÖ **No Magic Values**: All constants properly defined and referenced
