# Phase 26A & 26B: Complete System Integration Testing

## Phase 26A: Complete System Integration Testing Implementation
**Goal**: Test and validate complete workflows with real Claude API integration  
**Complete Feature**: Production-ready system with comprehensive integration testing replacing sophisticated mock system  
**Dependencies**: Phase 25B must be 100% complete with all tests passing
**OpenAI Reference**: Based on OpenAI API comprehensive testing standards for production deployment
**Performance Requirement**: Response times <2s for standard requests, <100ms for health checks

### Files to Create/Update
```
UPDATE: tests/e2e/ - Enable real Claude API integration tests (currently disabled with describe.skip)
UPDATE: tests/integration/ - Test complete request-response cycles with real Claude responses
UPDATE: src/middleware/error-handler.ts - Validate error handling with real Claude API errors
CREATE: tests/e2e/complete-workflows.test.ts - End-to-end workflow testing (SRP: E2E testing only)
CREATE: tests/integration/system-integration.test.ts - Complete system integration (SRP: integration only)
CREATE: tests/performance/load-testing.test.ts - Performance testing under load (SRP: performance only)

- **Interface Design**: Maximum 5 methods per interface, single-purpose interfaces

### Anti-Pattern Prevention (MANDATORY)
- **No God Classes**: SystemIntegrationTester <200 lines, focused on system integration testing only
- **No Deep Nesting**: Maximum 3 levels in system integration testing logic, use early returns
- **No Inline Complex Logic**: Extract complete system validation rules to named methods
- **No Hardcoded Values**: All system testing configuration in constants
- **No Direct Dependencies**: Use dependency injection for all external dependencies

### Testing Requirements (100% Complete & Passing)
- **Unit Tests**: SystemIntegrationTester, workflow validation, performance testing edge cases
